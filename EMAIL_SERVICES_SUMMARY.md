# Email Services Summary

## Current Email Implementation

The Panel Recut Management System now uses **SMTP-based email services only**. The following email providers are supported:

### 1. Gmail SMTP Service
- **File**: `src/services/gmailEmailService.ts`
- **Server**: `email-server/server.js` (endpoint: `/api/send-email`)
- **Configuration**: Gmail email + App Password
- **Protocol**: Gmail SMTP servers
- **Features**: Modern HTML templates, professional styling

### 2. Outlook SMTP Service  
- **File**: `src/services/outlookEmailService.ts`
- **Server**: `email-server/server.js` (endpoint: `/api/send-outlook-email`)
- **Configuration**: Outlook email + App Password
- **Protocol**: smtp-mail.outlook.com:587 with TLS
- **Features**: Modern HTML templates, professional styling

### 3. ~~Resend Service (API-based)~~ **[REMOVED]**
- ~~**File**: `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts`~~ **→ DISABLED**
- ~~**Configuration**: Resend API key~~
- ~~**Protocol**: Resend REST API~~
- ~~**Features**: Existing templates and functionality~~

**Note**: Resend service has been removed to eliminate CORS issues. The system now uses Gmail/Outlook SMTP only.

## How It Works

1. **Email Provider Selection**: The system checks `localStorage.getItem('email_provider')` to determine which service to use (**Gmail** or **Outlook** only)
2. **Credential Storage**: Each service stores its credentials in localStorage:
   - Gmail: `gmail_user`, `gmail_app_password`
   - Outlook: `outlook_user`, `outlook_app_password`
3. **Email Sending**: `damageRequestService.ts` routes emails to the appropriate SMTP service based on the selected provider

## Email Templates

Both Gmail and Outlook SMTP services feature:
- ✅ Modern, professional HTML templates
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
- ✅ Clean typography and spacing
- ✅ Company branding integration
- ✅ Removal of status badges for cleaner look
- ✅ "General" prefix removed from panel types
- ✅ Updated subject lines (no emoji)
- ✅ No footer text for minimal design

## Testing

- **Test Page**: `src/pages/EmailTestPageNew.tsx`
- **Server Testing**: `email-server/verify-email-services.js`
- **Outlook Troubleshooting**: `email-server/outlook-troubleshoot.js`

## Removed Components

The following components have been removed for a cleaner implementation:
- ❌ Google Apps Script email service (was never integrated)
- ❌ Gmail backend mock service (placeholder only)
- ❌ Basic email test page (replaced with comprehensive version)

## Configuration Files

- **Gmail Setup**: `GMAIL_SETUP.md`
- **Outlook Setup**: `OUTLOOK_SETUP.md`
- **Email Server Setup**: `email-server/README.md`
- **Outlook Troubleshooting**: `email-server/OUTLOOK-SETUP.md`

## Email Server

The email server (`email-server/server.js`) runs on port 3001 and provides:
- Gmail SMTP endpoint with connection verification
- Outlook SMTP endpoint with enhanced TLS configuration
- Detailed logging and error handling
- CORS support for frontend integration

## Usage

Users can choose their preferred email provider through the email configuration modal, and the system will automatically use the appropriate SMTP service for sending notifications.
