# Requested By Field Implementation

## Overview
Added a "Requested by" field to the damage report form to track who is requesting the panel recut.

## Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Types (`src/types/types.ts`)
- Added `requestedBy: string` field to the `DamageRequest` interface

### 2. Form Component (`src/components/DamageReportForm.tsx`)
- Added `requestedBy` field to form state
- Added validation for the required field
- Added UI input field with label "Requested By *"
- Updated form reset to include the new field

### 3. Database Schema (`supabase/setup.sql`)
- Added `requested_by VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL` column to `damage_requests` table
- Updated sample data to include requested_by values

### 4. Migration Script (`supabase/add-requested-by-migration.sql`)
- Created migration script for existing databases
- Adds the column and updates existing records with default values

### 5. Service Layer (`src/services/damageRequestService.ts`)
- Updated `CreateDamageRequestData` interface to include `requestedBy`
- Updated database insert to include `requested_by` field
- Updated all data mapping functions to include the new field
- Used type assertions to handle Supabase type definitions

### 6. Display Components (`src/components/RecentRequests.tsx`)
- Added "Requested by" display in the recent requests list

## Database Migration

### For New Installations
The updated `setup.sql` will create the table with the `requested_by` column.

### For Existing Databases
Run the migration script:
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i supabase/add-requested-by-migration.sql
```

## Testing
1. Fill out the damage report form
2. Verify "Requested By" field is required
3. Submit a request and verify it appears in recent requests with the requester's name
4. Check the database to ensure the `requested_by` field is populated

## UI Changes
- The "Requested By" field appears after the "Reason" field in the form
- It's marked as required with an asterisk (*)
- The field appears in the recent requests list showing who requested each recut
- Validation error shows if the field is left empty

## Data Structure
The field accepts any string value representing the name of the person requesting the recut. This provides flexibility for different naming conventions (full names, usernames, employee IDs, etc.).
